# Weekly Update #1

Today I announce that I am working on a new project: Privency.

The goal? Solving the dilemma between privacy and transparency on the web.

Without privacy, there is no freedom, nor freedom of speech. Being able to voice one's opinion is a fundamental right. Haven't we all been in a situation where we couldn't speak up or be rightfully heard on a specific topic because people would judge us based on unrelated aspects of our identity? Think subconscious biases and discriminations.

Without transparency, there is no justice. Who in their right mind would agree that pedophiles, scammers, anonymous mobs or money launderers should stay anonymous and go unpunished?

How does Privency solve this? By using zero-knowledge proofs of users credentials. Essentially applying a zero-knowledge local KYC that will serve as identifiers.

Users can log-in using their government ID without actually giving any information to the website.

This way, websites can make sure all users are unique human and prove characteristics about them (their nationality, their majority...etc), without ever having access to private info (who those persons really are?).

Privency is made of two products:
- Privency.tech - the auth toolbox
- Privency.org - the social network

Privency.tech is a toolbox that allow for web developers to create apps which authentication system is based on zkKYC without any specific knowledge.

Privency.org is a new form of social network that is built on top of Privency.tech. 
It is primarily designed for long-form deep conversations about serious topics, potentially controversial and political. 0% bots, 100% verified-anonymous humans. It features restricted groups of discussions per nationality/age/profession, public, trustless and decentralized voting and polling. Our democracies (as well as the people who don't have the chance to live in one) desperately need such an e-agora.

I just started working on a proof of concept to validate the technical feasibility.

I will be posting every week on the [Privency Weekly Updates blog repo](https://github.com/privency/weekly-updates), and I will regularly post updates about it on LinkedIn and Twitter.
